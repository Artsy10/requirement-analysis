Requirement Analysis in Software Development
The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.

What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of gathering, understanding, and defining what a project needs to succeed — from the client’s goals to the user’s expectations and the technical needs.

🧩 In Other Words:
It’s all about figuring out:

What the client wants

What the users need

What the product should do

How it should perform

Before any design, coding, or building begins, you need to analyze these requirements to make sure everyone’s on the same page.

🛠️ Key Steps Include:
Talking to stakeholders (clients, users, teams)

Researching and documenting needs

Identifying constraints and goals

Prioritizing requirements (must-have vs nice-to-have)

✅ Why It's Important:
Prevents misunderstandings

Saves time and money

Ensures the final product actually solves the right problem
