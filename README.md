Requirement Analysis in Software Development
The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.

What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of gathering, understanding, and defining what a project needs to succeed — from the client’s goals to the user’s expectations and the technical needs.

🧩 In Other Words:
It’s all about figuring out:

What the client wants

What the users need

What the product should do

How it should perform

Before any design, coding, or building begins, you need to analyze these requirements to make sure everyone’s on the same page.

🛠️ Key Steps Include:
Talking to stakeholders (clients, users, teams)

Researching and documenting needs

Identifying constraints and goals

Prioritizing requirements (must-have vs nice-to-have)

✅Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Prevents misunderstandings

Saves time and money

Ensures the final product actually solves the right problem

Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
1. ✅ Requirement Gathering
This is the first step, where you collect basic needs and expectations from stakeholders like clients, users, and managers. The goal is to get a general idea of what the project is supposed to do.

🛠️ Techniques used:

Client interviews

Surveys or questionnaires

Reviewing existing systems

🧠 Focus: What do they want or need?

2. 🔍 Requirement Elicitation
This activity goes deeper than just gathering. It involves actively exploring, clarifying, and uncovering the real requirements — including hidden needs that the stakeholders might not say directly.

🛠️ Techniques used:

Brainstorming sessions

Use case analysis

Workshops and focus groups

🧠 Focus: Why do they need it? Are there any constraints or assumptions?

3. 📝 Requirement Documentation
Once the requirements are understood, they are clearly written down in a structured format, so everyone is aligned. This becomes the official reference throughout the project.

📄 Common documents:

Software Requirement Specification (SRS)

User stories or acceptance criteria

🧠 Focus: Clarity, completeness, and traceability.

4. 📊 Requirement Analysis and Modeling
Now it's time to analyze and organize the documented requirements. You define how everything fits together, check for conflicts, feasibility, or duplicates, and sometimes create visual models or diagrams.

🛠️ Tools used:

Flowcharts, wireframes, or UML diagrams

Prioritization techniques like MoSCoW

🧠 Focus: Is it logical, achievable, and well-structured?

5. ✅ Requirement Validation
Before moving forward, the team and stakeholders review and confirm the requirements to ensure they are accurate, complete, and agreed upon. This reduces the risk of rework later.

🛠️ Techniques used:

Walkthroughs and reviews

Prototypes or mockups

Client sign-offs
